Keep in mind that typical studies, whether in academic or in commercial applications, typically do not follow a straight path. As a result of this, the output is typically produced after many iterations, deviations, and potential changes in course. Living labs are longitudinal and adaptive by nature. In science, researchers uncover insights that may be different from what they originally anticipated, and in business individuals may uncover new and unexpected business and improvement opportunities. You need to ensure that you spend enough time in the exploration phase of real-life projects, while ensuring that you deliver actionable results in the required timeframes. A good approach is to start with a minimum viable product and add features to this product as your project matures."
