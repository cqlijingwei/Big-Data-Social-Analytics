    "The video lectures highlighted the importance of understanding graphs as data representation objects that can capture and describe relationships between data entities. Applications of graphs extend across numerous network types including transportation, geographical, and social networks. The weight associated with each edge in the graph often represents the similarity between the two vertices it connects, or the strength of such a relationship. The earlier notebooks demonstrated how to explore and exploit edge structure (connectedness) properties in order to understand the structure of the graphs. You were then able to use this knowledge in clustering and the identification of communities in graphs using graph partitioning algorithms. The data on these graphs can be visualized as a finite collection of samples, with one sample at each vertex in the graph, and each such sample described by a scalar value. The collection of these scalar samples defined on each vertex of a graph is referred to as a graph signal. The [figure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.0053v2.pdf) below shows an example of a graph signal, where each bar represents a random positive value generated on the vertices of a Petersen graph (Shuman et al. 2013).\n",

    "\n",
    "Graph signal processing can be considered a generalization of the classical signal processing framework in the graph spectral domain. As discussed in the videos, just as the frequency-based domain representation of a signal decomposes a signal into harmonics of varying frequencies, graph signal processing demonstrates how fast a graph signal changes with respect to graph topology. For example, this can be used in, say, tracking the shifts of personal preferences between friends in a social network. \n",
    "\n",
    "In graph signal processing, the graph Laplacian matrix is the core operator. The spectral decomposition of this matrix provides eigenvectors that correspond to bases similarly to sinusoidal functions in classical frequency analysis. Similarly to applications of Fourier transforms, graph-based signal processing can be used in compression, denoising, interpolation, and many other applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications of graph signal processing include:\n",
    "- **Sensor networks:** This is in terms of the relative positions of sensors (kNN), and temperature. Does temperature vary smoothly?\n",
    "- **Social network analysis:** This analysis can be done on aspects such as friendship, relationship, and age. Are friends of similar age?\n",
    "- **Image processing:** This is in terms of pixel positions and similarity, pixel values, discontinuities and smoothness.\n",
    "- **Mobility inference:** This inference can enable an understanding of people’s behaviors, while simultaneously protecting their privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, this notebook will demonstrate certain simple filtering applications based on graph signal processing. To complete this task, you will make use of [pygsp](http://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the graph signal processing python library. The libraries utilized in this module is have not been installed.  Do not attempt to execute these steps. Simply review this notebook and complete the theory-based questions only.\n",
